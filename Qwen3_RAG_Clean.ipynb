The reason...\" if len(doc) > 150 else f\"     --- Page 1 --- Dear Shareholders: Last year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future. Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us. In 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B. Further, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B). While we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. In our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay). Being sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year. We also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY .

These businesses will keep shifting online and into the cloud. In Media and Advertising, content will continue to migrate from linear formats to streaming. Globally, hundreds of millions of peoplewho don’t have adequate broadband access will gain that connectivity in the next few years. Last butcertainly not least, Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (whichitself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet. Unlike the mass modernization of on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, where there’s work required to migrate, this GenAI revolution will bebuilt from the start on top of the cloud. The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions thatwill be possible will astound us all. There has never been a time in Amazon’s history where we’ve felt there is so much opportunity to make our customers’ lives better and easier. We’re incredibly excited about what’s possible, focused on inventing thefuture, and look forward to working together to make it so. Sincerely, Andy Jassy President and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc. P .S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997. --- Page 9 --- 1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS (Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report) To our shareholders: Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressivecompetitive entry. But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate thevery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets. We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitivelandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offeringsand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to movequickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunitiesin other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not withoutrisk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders. It’s All About the Long Term We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translatedirectly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly\n",

By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again. The past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.) We’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them: We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video. In October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems— rare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got along way to go, but are encouraged by our progress. Overall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of customers. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination --- Page 3 --- across Amazon.

Our Employees The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, thesingle most important element of Amazon.com’s success. It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, somethingthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com. Goals for 1998 We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments. We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do. 1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement. Jeffrey P .

The reason...\" if len(doc) > 150 else f\"     --- Page 1 --- Dear Shareholders: Last year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future. Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us. In 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B. Further, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B). While we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. In our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay). Being sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year. We also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023). Our regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve.

These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast. While we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately be built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS. (By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some of their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track recordin the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.) ===Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its wording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ. Today, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual opportunities for growth across the areas in which we operate. For instance, while we have a nearly $500B consumer business,about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. Similarly, with a cloudcomputing business at nearly a $100B revenue run rate, more than 85% of the global IT spend is still --- Page 8 --- on-premises. These businesses will keep shifting online and into the cloud. In Media and Advertising, content will continue to migrate from linear formats to streaming.\n",

The growth was primarily driven by their sponsored ads. Additionally, they recently introduced Sponsored TV, which is a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming TV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch. They have also expanded their streaming TV advertising by incorporating ads into Prime Video shows and movies, targeting over 200 million monthly viewers in their most popular entertainment offerings.\n",

Specifically, it states that Amazon's Advertising grew 24% year-over-year from $38 billion in 2022 to $47 billion in 2023. The growth was primarily driven by their sponsored ads. Additionally, they recently introduced Sponsored TV, which is a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming TV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch. They also expanded their streaming TV advertising by incorporating ads into Prime Video shows and movies, targeting over 200 million monthly viewers in their most popular entertainment offerings.\n",

      "--- Page 1 --- Dear Shareholders: Last year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future. Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us. In 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B. Further, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B). While we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. In our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay). Being sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year. We also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023). Our regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\n",
